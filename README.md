# Preface
Whilest reading you might encounter certain terms like IP, GP and S3, these refer to the terms Individual Project, Group Project and Semester 3 respectively. I'll start with showing all products I made this semester and then we will go into the researches I did. Nothing else to add, have fun reading.

# Products
This semester I had to realise all the learning outcomes of semester 3. Per product I will explain how i realised the corresponding learning outcome. Here's a list with all the learning outcomes. I'll also include a list of requirements I have to realise this semester in my individual project.
