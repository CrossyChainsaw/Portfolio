# Preface
Whilest reading you might encounter certain terms like IP, GP and S3, these refer to the terms Individual Project, Group Project and Semester 3 respectively. I'll start with showing all products I made this semester and then we'll go into the researches I did. Nothing else to add, have fun reading.

# Products
This semester I had to realise all the learning outcomes of semester 3. Per product I will explain how i realised the corresponding learning outcome. Here's a list with all the learning outcomes. I'll also include a list of requirements I have to realise this semester in my individual project.

# Reverse Hangman Online
Reverse Hangman Online is a game I made for my individual project. I will explain per learning outcome how I realised it with my individual project. Everthing about Reverse Hangman Online itself can be found in its documentation.

## Learning Outcome 1
*You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications.*

Clarification

Tooling and methodology: Carry out, monitor and report on unit integration, regression and system tests, with attention for security and performance aspects, as well as applying static code analysis and code reviews.

Reverse Hangman Online is my full-stack web application.

### Front-end
The front-end has been made in React-TypeScript

### Back-end
The back-end has partially been made in C# .Net and partially in Java Spring

### UX-Testing
I sadly haven't been able to do user experience testing since my application wasn't done yet. So I couldn't let someone test it. Parts of my application were done quite early but the game itself wasn't.

## Learning Outcome 2
*You use software tooling and methodology that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development.*


# Restaurant Ordering System
GP

# Ranknir
Ranknir is a discord bot I coded for fun in my spare time this semester. I've made lots of side projects this semester, but since I really like this one a lot I've put it here. Read more about Ranknir in it's documentation.

# Research

## Which database fits my application the best?
For this research I made use of the [DOT framework](https://ictresearchmethods.nl/The_DOT_Framework).

**What**: I want to research which database fit my application the best.

**Why**: Instead of choosing a random database, I'd like to know which database fits my application the best. Because if you realize you chose the wrong database in the middle of the project it might cost a lot of time, effort and money(for a company, I'm just a student).

**How**: Find multiple articles about how to choose the right database for your application, validate them, and use them for my project.
