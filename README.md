Starting this semester i had never worked with java before, so i had no idea how everything worked and what to do. The teachers had recommended to follow a playlist of videos from JavaBrains. They explained how to setup 3 microservices in java and how to make them communicate with each other. this playlist was very helpful to understand microservices and it helped me get into java.

Making a start with React TypeScript was very hard, without any experience i hopped in vscode and tried to do anything. This didn't work out at all. everything i tried failed. My classmate [Mike van den Hoef](https://github.com/Headoros) was always willing to help me but still, it wouldn't work out this way. I decided to plan a TypeScript spike. In this spike i gathered information from the [W3schools TypeScript tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/index.php) and at the same time i practised everything i was learning in a test project.
