### Java
I had never worked with java before, so it might be pretty useful to work once with Java aswel. The teachers had recommended me to follow a [playlist of videos from JavaBrains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8IQb4ofjDo&list=PLqq-6Pq4lTTZSKAFG6aCDVDP86Qx4lNas&index=2). They explain how to setup 3 microservices in java and how to make them communicate with each other. this playlist was very helpful to understand microservices and it helped me get into java.

### TypeScript
Making a start with React TypeScript was very hard, without any experience I hopped in vscode and tried to do anything. This didn't work out at all. Everything I tried failed. My classmate [Mike van den Hoef](https://github.com/Headoros) was always willing to help me but still, It wouldn't work out this way. I decided to plan a TypeScript spike. In this spike I gathered information from the [W3schools TypeScript tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/index.php) and at the same time i practised everything I was learning in a test project. TypeScript is such an awesome languange.

### React
I also planned a React spike, same concept as above, I just try to gather as much information about React and try to implement it. I really like this type of learning and it always works out for me. For React I used the [W3schools React tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/REACT/default.asp). In my opinion W3schools has the best tutorials to learn the basics.

### The Coding Den
Always if i get stuck with a coding problem, I try to google it myself first. But if I really can't find an answer I ask help in a discord called [The Coding Den](https://discord.gg/code). In this discord you can ask question about basically any coding language. It always has been really usefull for me so, big shoutout to them :)
